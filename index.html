                            Anouska's cleaning company was a lot of fun to work with. Requiring an Alice in Wonderland theme we had multiple pieces of artwork put together for this site. Building
                            the site as well as working with Anouska was a lot of fun as we agreed a design, a custom logo and assets to use for this one.

                        <p>
                            Ash is an outstanding developer with a unique ability to adapt to the way we work as a digital agency at Conceptai Design Studios. He is always learning new things in order to add to the 
                            plethora of skills he already has, making him extremely valuable to us. Great organisational skills and time management make working with Ash easy. I would highly recommend him for any 
                            web development work. An extremely experienced and talented developer and a huge asset to our team.

                            Ash is so helpful, he's easy to communicate with and listens to ideas well. He has been a joy to work with and keeps you in touch with all developments throughout the process. 
                            I would highly recommend Ash, he will go above and beyond to make sure you are happy with his work. I didn't have any idea about website design and the technical jargon that goes with it. 
                            Ash has been very kind, helpful and easy to talk to, he explains everything clearly if you need him to and is also a fast worker once he knows what you want. Thank you Ash for all you 
                            help and hard work.

                            I can highly recommend Ash, he is patient, knowledgeable and very talented. I absolutely love my website that Ash produced, it's has amazing graphics, clean lines, and is intuitively 
                            user friendly. Ash is a perfectionist who goes the extra mile. Since producing my website he has also put together leaflets and business cards that look amazing. I will use Ash again in 
                            the future, I really wouldn't go anywhere else. He is also an extremely lovely guy.

                            Had a coding problem with a 'Caculator' script after moving a client's web site host. Ash came to the rescue and the problem was solved very quickly. His fee was so modest that he got an extra 'bung'! 
                            Thoroughly recommend this delightful chap.

                            Ash is a fantastic developer and incredibly talented. He is a highly motivated individual often going above and beyond to complete projects. He has been a great asset to the team and it

                            I can heartily recommend Ash as a great person to work with in every respect. He's great fun, very down to earth, and a highly qualified subject matter expert across all elements of web 
                            development. In addition he's an able communicator, comfortable sharing ideas with others regardless of their technical background, discipline and capabilities. Ash has no problem absorbing 
                            technical information, asking questions and checking appropriately to ensure he fully understands what needs to be delivered, how and when.
